# MDP-DP-RL

The goal of this project was to develop all Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning algorithms
from scratch (i.e., with no use of standard libraries, except for basic numpy and scipy tools). The
 "develop from scratch" goal was motivated by educational purposes - students learning this topic
 can understand the concepts throroughly only when they develop and work with code developed from
 scratch. I teach courses on this topic to a variety of student backgrounds, and each such course
 is big on precise programming implementations of the techniques/algorithms. In particular, I plan
 to use this codebase to assist with Stanford CME 241: Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic
 Control Problems in Finance (a course I am teaching at Stanford during Winter 2019).
 Any feedback on code readability, performance and bugs will be greatly appreciated as the code
 is still fairly raw and untested in various parts (started working on this code in August 2018,
 and have mainly been in code-growth mode so far).
 
 The project started by implementing the foundational data structures for finite Markov Processes
 (a.k.a. Markov Chains), Markov Reward Processes (MRP), and Markov Decision Processes (MDP). This was followed by
 Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms, where the focus was to represent Bellman equations in clear mathematical
 terms within the code. Next was the core educational material of Reinforcement Learning, implementing
 the Generalized Policy Iteration algorithms based on simulations (Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference,
 including eligibility traces). However, the emphasis was to first implement the tabular methods so that
 one can work with actual data structures (finite, hence tabular), rather than functions to represent
 MDP rewards and transition specifications as well as value functions and policies. Once the tabular RL
 methods were implemented, it was straightforward to write the same algorithms as functional approximation-based
 algorithms. However, this required a detour to build some foundation for function approximation. I chose
 to implement linear and deep neural network approximations, both of which require a specification of 
 feature functions. Backpropagation was developed from scratch, again for educational purposes. On a whim,
 I also implemented Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) Algorithms, which was basically the same old
 Policy Iteration and Value Iteration algorithms but now using the output of function approximation for
 the right-hand-side of the Bellman update, and using the updated values as training data for gradient
 descent on the parameters of the function approximation. So far, I am finding ADP
 as the most valuable algorithm for the MDP problems I typically work with. I am a bit surprised that the
 "literature" focuses so much on model-free whereas I often know the model for many of the MDPs I work on,
 and so, ADP is ideal.
  
 I have chosen Python 3 as the language, mainly because I can't expect my students to have expertise in
 the potentially more-appropriate languages for this project, such as Scala, Ocaml and Haskell. These are
 functional programming languages and this topic/project is best done through a tasteful application of
 Functional Progamming. But Python 3 is not such a bad choice as functions are fast-class entities. My core
 technique in this project is indeed Functional Programming, but I had to very careful in getting around
 Python's "naughty" handling of function closures. I have also made heavy use of classes and TypeVars.
 Object-oriented polymorphism as well as type-parametrized polymorphism enabled me to cover a wide range of
 algorithms with plenty of common code. Python 3 also provided me the benefit of type annotations, which I
 have taken heavy advantage of in this project. Type annotations support turned out to be extremely valuable
 in the project as my IDE (PyCharm) caught a lot of  errors/warnings statically, in fact as I was typing code,
 it would spot errors. More importantly, type annotations makes the interfaces very clear and I believe any
 sort of mathematical programming needs a strong style of type annotations (if not static typing).
 
 This is how the modules of the project are organized.
 
 processes: All about Markov Processes, MRP, MDP and classes that serve as minimal but complete representations
 of an MDP for specific classes of algorithms, eg: a representation for tabular RL, a representation for function
 approximation RL, and a representation for ADP. A lot of the heavy lifting is done in the "helper" sub-module
 mp_funcs.py
 
func_approx: Linear and Deep-Neural Network (DNN) function approximation. Implements function evaluation (forward
propagation for DNN) and gradient calculation/gradient descent (backward propagation for DNN) using ADAM. Took
advantage of numpy vectors, matrices, tensors and efficiently computing with them.

algorithms: within this, we have the modules dp (for Dynamic Programming), adp (for Approximate Dynamic Programming),
rl_tabular (for Tabular RL - Monte Carlo, SARSA, Q-Learning, Expected SARSA), rl_func_aprprox (for Function
Approximation RL - same algorithms as Tabular RL). Note that I have implemented TD(0) and TD(Lambda) separately
for both Tabular RL and Function Approximation RL, although TD(0) is a special case of TD(Lambda). TD(0) was
implemented separately for the usual reason in the project - that I find it easy to introduce a special case (in
this case TD(0)) for pedagogical reasons and so showing students TD(0) as a special case with simpler/lighter
code that focuses on the concept (versus the complication of eligibility traces) is quite beneficial. This is the
same reason I implemented Tabular (Tabular is a special case of Linear Function Approximation where the features
are indicator functions, one for each of the states/state-action pairs). Note the deep object-oriented inheritance
hiereracy - rooted at the abstract base class OptBase. Note also that a lot of heavy lifting happens in the
module helper_funcs.py.

examples: A few common examples of problems that seem ripe for RL, eg: Windy Grid, Inventory Control.

utils: Some generic utility functions to transform data structures.

----------------------
Coming soon are LSTD and Policy Gradient Algorithms (the latter is motivated by the inability of the currently
implemented algorithms to handle continuous action spaces, eg: for the Portfolio Management example).
